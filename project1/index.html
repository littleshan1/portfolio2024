        <h3>Fashion Design：</h3>
        <p>1. Chinese Emperor Living in the West</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inspiration</li>
          <p>
            I was inspired by the last Chinese emperor-Pu Yi. For centuries,
            Chinese emperors wore imperial dragon robes.But Pu Yi received
            western influences and enjoyed wearing suites, dark sunglasses, and
            even got an English name- Henry. He was an important person who
            influenced the chinese constume history.
          </p>
          <li>Design concept</li>
          <p>
            Black suits and yellow imperial robes are the main colors. The
            combination of chinese and western costumes also represents
            rigidness and softness, which makes the design motif- chinese totem
            and western cuttings.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Be Myself</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inspiration</li>
          <p>
            Focusing on myself to present my painting style. I like wearing
            loose and colorful clothes. These feathers are further accentuated.
          </p>
          <li>Design concept</li>
          <p>
            Each print has its own meaning. In the crowd, we all crave to be the
            unique one. Physically I have my own symbol. We need to make reverse
            thinking so that we will not become the fish going downstream.
          </p>

        <h3>Marketing Project：</h3>
        <p>Integrated marketing communications- Lotus</p>
        <p>
          The subject of this marketing communications study is the Lotus Eletre
          line. There are six parts to this study. The first is an analysis of
          the target audience and the condition of the brand, including
          information relating to the reasons for the selection of the target
          and the challenges the brand faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The report then discusses marketing objectives and strategies in order
          to comprehend the existing plans of the brand, improve the marketing
          strategy and propose new solutions to ensure that the brand is able to
          compete with other brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, a budget and a review of the marketing strategy are included
          to assist the company in the planning of its marketing budget and to
          determine whether these techniques are beneficial for facilitating
          further brand improvement.
